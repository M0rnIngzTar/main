<h2>👨‍💻 Networking Project:</h2>
<h3>🔭<a href= "https://github.com/M0rnIngzTar/Project1">Network Infrastructure</a></h3>
<h4>Summary</h4>

The objective was to design a network topology that enables seamless connectivity between these two sites, allowing users in both locations to share resources and collaborate efficiently.

<h2>👨‍💻 University Dissertation:</h2>
Currently Adding it! Please bare with me as it have 90 pages✨

To be expected:

My dissertation explores the positive and negative impacts of technology on society, particularly for individuals aged 18-30. Instead of developing a website, I designed a high-fidelity UX/UI prototype using Figma to create an engaging and accessible experience. The prototype visually presents the benefits of technology—such as connectivity, entertainment, and productivity—while also addressing its drawbacks, including addiction, hyperconnectivity, and decreased motivation. The project involved extensive research, ideation, and evaluation to ensure it effectively educates users while remaining user-friendly and enjoyable. Ultimately, this design helps users reflect on whether technology is a savior or a destroyer in their lives.
